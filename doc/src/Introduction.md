# Introduction to the Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit
Thank you for downloading the Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit (NVGT) by Sam Tupy Productions and contributors. We hope you find the time that you invest in this engine to be worthwhile!

The NVGT documentation contains:
* The NVGT user manual; containing everything from programming resources to general tutorials to example games,
* API references; Class/function references that specify exactly how to use each feature of the engine,
* Advanced topics; Documentation on the c++ side of the NVGT engine including how to build the engine from source, modify it's security functions, write documentation for the engine and more,
* Appendix; data tables that don't fit in the API references, miscellaneous topics, attributions and license agreements.

## Documentation status
It should be noted that this engine was only released to the public on May 31st 2024, and that the documentation is not yet complete as a result. Though the engine had been in development for years previously, the decision to open source it, and thus to write documentation for it, only took place a couple of months before the initial release. The choice was made to release the engine in an unpolished state specifically so that the community can help improve it, otherwise the engine would have remained private for years while only a couple of people worked in their spair time to complete the documentation. The engine is very usable and a growing community exists on Discord for any questions you might have, certainly we welcome all users! However those involved with the engine's development are also not personally advertising the engine yet due to it's unpolished state. Contributions to the documentation and other materials are therefor very appreciated, though you may want to hold off if you are the type looking for a particularly polished and pretty looking product at this time. Whether you decide to try the engine now or wait until the documentation is complete, we hope you enjoy your time engaging with NVGT and thank you for trying it!
