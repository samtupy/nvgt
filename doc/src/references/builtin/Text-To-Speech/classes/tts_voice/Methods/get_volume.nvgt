/**
	Get the text to speech voice's volume (how loud it is).
	int tts_voice::get_volume();
	## Returns:
		int: the current volume in percentage.
	## Remarks:
		0 is silent, 100 is loudest. If this hasn't been assigned, it will use the OS setting which may not be 100%. Beware if running old code, this is different from bgt having 0 be the max.

// Example:
void main() {
	tts_voice v;
	v.set_volume(50);
	alert("the current volume is: ", ""+v.get_volume());
