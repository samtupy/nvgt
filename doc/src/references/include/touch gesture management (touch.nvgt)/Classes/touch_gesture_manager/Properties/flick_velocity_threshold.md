# flick_velocity_threshold
The minimum velocity (normalized distance per second) required to trigger a flick gesture instead of a regular swipe.

```float flick_velocity_threshold = 1.5f;```

## Remarks:
Flick gestures are faster versions of swipes that can trigger different actions in your interface.
